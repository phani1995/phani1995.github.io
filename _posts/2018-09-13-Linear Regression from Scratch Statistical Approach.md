# Linear Regression from Scratch Statistical Approach



## The Theory

Linear Regression is the process of fitting a line to the dataset.

## Single Variable Linear Regression

## The Mathematics

The equation of Line is

Where,
 y = dependent variable
 X = independent variable
C = intercept 

The algorithm is trying to fit a line to the data by adjusting the values of m and c. Its Objective is to attain to a value of m such that for any given value of x it would be properly predicting the value of y.

There are various ways in which we can attain the values of m and c 

* Statistical approach
* Iterative approach

In this post we are discussing Statistical approach. If you find the derivation too long you can take look ar final m and c formulas.
We were given data, set of x and y values and we were asked to find a line which best fits that which means mathematically we should be able to fine the slope and c values of the line to describe the line.
The derivation to the slope and intercept values of the line
The equation of the Line is
